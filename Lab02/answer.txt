Question:
1. When should accessor methods be used?





2. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
--> Answer:
Yes, Java allows this, because Java supports constructor overloading,which means a class can have multiple constructors as long as each has a different parameter list (method signature).
